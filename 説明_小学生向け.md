# Simple Explanation

This app shows your GitHub repositories, issues, pull requests, and activity in one place.

It has four pages:
- Dashboard: a quick summary
- List: search and filter items
- Kanban: move cards between columns
- Timeline: see events by time

To use it, add your GitHub token in the API `.env` file.
